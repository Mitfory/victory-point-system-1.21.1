# * - applicable only to reset subcommand; only usable via console for security reasons.

# points-per-kill-list-override list functions in format "EntityType:Amount"
# Refer to: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
# Default values: Player - 200, Passive mob - 10, Monster - 20, Wither/Dragon - 400, Warden: 500

# PlaceholderAPI placeholders:
# The format is %vp_top_X_(SORT_METHOD)_(name or amount)% and 'Top 10' positions can be sorted by:
# level, points, all-kills, player-kills, deaths, kd, passive-mob-kills or aggressive-mob-kills
# EXAMPLE (top 7 passive mob kill position's nickname): %vp_top_7_passive-mob-kills_name%

# Don't know what placeholders are or how to use them? Refer to: https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/

# EXTRA INFO: It's best to keep health perk values as full integers, as Minecraft works weird
# While testing, I found that most of the time it doesn't give the half-heart or gives a full one
